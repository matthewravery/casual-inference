When I was in school, I was applied Statistician, but now folks would probably call me a "Data Scientist." I'm empirical in my approach and generally skeptical of emminence-based decision-making. I'm a fan of Nate Silver, Douglas Adams, and Boris Diaw. 

I work in Defense, so the content of this blog will about things that are mostly or entirely unrelated to my day job. I'm hoping that forcing myself to write things down will help me interogate my own thought processes and biases.
