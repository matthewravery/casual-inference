      <description>When I was in school, I was applied Statistician, but now folks would probably call me a &amp;ldquo;Data Scientist.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m empirical in my approach and generally skeptical of emminence-based decision-making. I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of Nate Silver, Douglas Adams, and Boris Diaw.
I work in Defense, so the content of this blog will about things that are mostly or entirely unrelated to my day job. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that forcing myself to write things down will help me interogate my own thought processes and biases.</description>

      <title>Philosophy Analysis Statement</title>

      <description>From what I understand, teaching professors (maybe all professors?) write a &amp;ldquo;Philosophy of Teaching Statement&amp;rdquo;. The goal of this documen is to describe the individual&amp;rsquo;s approach to teaching and why they use that approach. It basically says, &amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I do, and here&amp;rsquo;s why I do it,&amp;rdquo; and maybe you get into a little bit of how they got there. In my view, it&amp;rsquo;s akin to a teaching world-view. It&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity for a professor to organize (and interrogate a little) their entire approach to their chosen profession.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of this article is to make sure that all basic HTML Elements are decorated with CSS so as to not miss any possible elements when creating new themes for Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hugo uses the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/&#34;&gt;html/template&lt;/a&gt; library for
its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very
small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of
logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other
template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of
similarities in Go templates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>
