      <title>DIY Metrics:  Full-season five-man Plus/Minus</title>

      <description>Previously on DIY Metrics, we did some remedial cleaning on the full 17-18 play-by-play data set. Today, we’re going to take that clean data, generate full-season five-man plus/minus numbers, and then do some plotting!
Cleaning, againSo, turns out there were a few bugs that I didn’t catch the first time we went through the cleaning process. This is fairly typical in my experience: You’ll go through your data cleaning and think everything is Gucci only to find once you start your analysis that there are irregularities or issues you hadn’t considered.</description>

      <title>DIY Metrics:  Preparing a new data set</title>

      <description>So I finally broke down and got a full season’s worth of NBA play-by-play data to work on. Going forward, I’ll be using the full 2017-2018 play-by-play data from NBAstuffer.
To date, I’ve been building my scripts using functional programming with the goal of having each step easily work with new data sets. This will be a good test of whether I’ve been successful!
But before we do that, we need to look at the new data set and see what, if anything has changed.</description>

      <title>Distributionality</title>

      <description>This is an update to my Analysis Philosphy page, which is still working towards completion
I only get 1,750 hits on Google when I search for “Distributionality”, so maybe I should clarify what I mean, though I don’t think it’s anything profound.
That data follow distributions is a tautology. When this doesn’t appear the case, it means we’ve failed to properly model hte data generation function. The most typical failure mode is to assume that the distribution is simpler than it is.</description>

      <title>DIY Metrics:  Net Ratings (ish)</title>

      <description>Last time on DIY Metrics, we calculated five-man-unit plus/minus ratings from scratch. If we want to use measures like this to compare performance for these groups of players, its important to consider how much game time we have for each unit. There’s a relevant discussion to be had about whether “number of posessions” or “elapsed time” is the best way to compare these groups, (IMO, it depends on what specific question you’re trying to answer with your metric) but today we’ll avoid that discussion and normalize over time because it’s easier.</description>

      <description>I mean the term of art, not the concept or field of study. And what’s dumb is how it’s applied. “Machine learning” is also dumb in a similar way.
Some definitions for AIYou can go back to the beginning if the field if you want to, but modern definitions tend to to be vague. There are good definitions out there, but these sound esoteric and unless you’re really interested in defining AI precisely, you’ll probably just stick with Merriam-Webster or Wikipedia, which means literally:</description>

      <title>DIY Metrics:  Five-Man Unit Plus/Minus</title>

      <guid>/post/diy-metrics-five-man-unit-plus-minus/</guid>
      <description>Last week, I described how to build a plus/minus score for individual players based on data from NBAstuffer. I enjoyed walking through that process, so lets continue the series and expand our focus.
Five-man units vs. Individual PlayersOne of the first things I talked about on this site was comparing different metrics and choosing the right one for the task at hand. Plus/minus for individual players is a weird metric, because it’s taking a team outcome (net change in score) and applying it at an individual level.</description>

      <title>Local Polynomial Smoothing</title>

      <description>So this is a blast from the past. NC State (at least while I was there) did something interesting for their prelim. Instead of taking another test like we had to do at the Masters level, they gave all their students a subject unrelated to their research, and had them write a lit review and do a small simulation study.
My topic was local polynomial smoothing. I don’t think I did a particularly good job, but afterwards, I posted it on my NCSU website as an example of things I’d written.</description>

      <description>In order to better understand some “advanced metrics”, I figured it’d be useful to build them from scratch. (This is also just a fun exercise in data manipulation, cleaning, etc.)
For starters, let’s do something easy, namely raw plus/minus. For the code below, I’m using the free example play-by-play data set from NBAstuffer. They seem reputable, though I do have concerns about how widely-used their formatting is; one of the challenges with building a workflow is ensuring that the structure of your incoming data won’t change.</description>

      <title>The Arrogance of &#34;Noise&#34;</title>

      <description>This is a post about communication.
One of the through-lines of my academic and professional career is conflict between entrenched subject matter experts (SME) and hot-shot quantitative analysts. As a young undergraduate, I followed Baseball Prospectus Fangraphs through the SABRmetric revolution. I watched Nate Silver bring data-driven prognostication to the world of political journalism which had previously (and arguably still is) dominated by punditry. In my current job, I work with experienced analysts who have often been working on the same systems for years.</description>

      <title>Data Science and Data Generation Processes</title>

      <description>I was talking about a curriculum for a new Data Science degree program, and the topic of experimental design came up. Design of Experiments (DOE) is classical subject area for statisticians, and the context of an applied statistics masters degree makes perfect sense, but in the context of data science, it seemed pretty out of place. I say that not because DOE isn&amp;rsquo;t important but because I think its something &amp;ldquo;data science&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t often consider.</description>

      <title>Calibration update, now with Brier Scores!</title>

      <description>After reading my my previous post on calibration, my clever wife (who’s been doing calibration-related activities in the context of modeling and simulation) brought to my attention the concept of Brier Scores. (Alternatively, here.) This approach was originally proposed to evaluate weather forecasts (“Verification of weather forecasts has been a controversial subject for more than half a century,” so at least we’ve moved on controversial climate forecasts in this half-century.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, Scott Alexander posted his annual predictions review post. I always enjoy this post because it’s externalized introspection. Scott takes the time to formally look at things he thought, consider how right he was about these things, and consider how it should update his thinking moving forward. Most people don’t do this informally let alone formally!
I want to respond to two things in the post, the latter of which is answering the question Scott only implies of whether he’s well-correlated or not.</description>

      <description>I wanted to talk a little bit more about how different metrics account for variation in player performance, and some various flavors of NBA plus/minus statistics provide nice examples. This is building a bit off of some concepts I discussed in Choosing the right metric for sports.
Plus/Minus MetricsOne approach for estimating individual player contribution to overall outcome is to look at the net points scored while an individual player was on the court.</description>

      <description>When I was in school, I was an applied Statistician, but now folks would probably call me a &amp;ldquo;Data Scientist.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m empirical in my approach and generally skeptical of emminence-based decision-making. I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of Nate Silver, Douglas Adams, and Boris Diaw.
I work in Defense, so the content of this blog will about things that are mostly or entirely unrelated to my day job. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that forcing myself to write things down will help me interogate my own thought processes and biases.</description>

      <description>I think its great that sports statistics are a big thing in popular media. It makes fans and media better informed about their team and players, and it provides an entry point for people to get interestd in statistics.
That said, there seems to be a perpetual innumeracy in the way folks talk about a lot of these metrics. One thing I see come up repeatedly is the distinction between metrics that look at a player’s past performance and say, “How important was that player to the team’s success?</description>

      <description>From what I understand, teaching professors (maybe all professors?) write a &amp;ldquo;Philosophy of Teaching Statement&amp;rdquo;. The goal of this documen is to describe the individual&amp;rsquo;s approach to teaching and why they use that approach. It basically says, &amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I do, and here&amp;rsquo;s why I do it,&amp;rdquo; and maybe you get into a little bit of how they got there. In my view, it&amp;rsquo;s akin to a teaching world-view. It&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity for a professor to organize (and interrogate a little) their entire approach to their chosen profession.</description>

      <description>Nate Duncan’s “Dunc’d On” is probably my favorite NBA podcast. He and frequent co-host Danny Leroux are analytical and comprehensive, covering the whole league. About every other week, they’ll go through ever team in a conference (East or West) and talk about how each team is doing, where they’re projected to finish, etc. They call these episodes “15 in 60”, although they don’t always get to all 15 teams in the conference, and I don’t think they’ve ever done one of these in 60 minutes.</description>

      <description>Not the bit about plays, the bit about sonnets.
Writing song parodies is like writing sonnetsSonnets are an interesting because of how restrictive they are. According to American poet Aaron Kramer
First, you are handcuffed by having to write fourteen lines. Then, you are shackled by having to write with a set meter. They put you into a sack called rhyme. But think what a magic act it is if you can set your meaning free!</description>
