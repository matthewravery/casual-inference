      <description>Yesterday, Scott Alexander posted his annual predictions review post. I always enjoy this post because it’s externalized introspection. Scott takes the time to formally look at things he thought, consider how right he was about these things, and consider how it should update his thinking moving forward. Most people don’t do this informally let alone formally!
I want to respond to two things in the post, the latter of which is answering the question Scott only implies of whether he’s well-correlated or not.</description>
