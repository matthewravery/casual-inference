      <description>I was talking about a curriculum for a new Data Science degree program, and the topic of experimental design came up. Design of Experiments (DOE) is classical subject area for statisticians, and the context of an applied statistics masters degree makes perfect sense, but in the context of data science, it seemed pretty out of place. I say that not because DOE isn&amp;rsquo;t important but because I think its something &amp;ldquo;data science&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t often consider.</description>

      <description>After reading my my previous post on calibration, my clever wife (who’s been doing calibration-related activities in the context of modeling and simulation) brought to my attention the concept of Brier Scores. (Alternatively, here.) This approach was originally proposed to evaluate weather forecasts (“Verification of weather forecasts has been a controversial subject for more than half a century,” so at least we’ve moved on controversial climate forecasts in this half-century.</description>

      <title>Is Scott well-calibrated?</title>

      <description>Yesterday, Scott Alexander posted his annual predictions review post. I always enjoy this post because it’s externalized introspection. Scott takes the time to formally look at things he thought, consider how right he was about these things, and consider how it should update his thinking moving forward. Most people don’t do this informally let alone formally!
I want to respond to two things in the post, the latter of which is answering the question Scott only implies of whether he’s well-correlated or not.</description>
